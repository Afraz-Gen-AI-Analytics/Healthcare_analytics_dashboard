# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
The **Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** is a fully interactive and data-driven business intelligence solution designed to analyze patient, treatment, and operational performance within the healthcare sector. This project demonstrates my ability to perform **end-to-end data analytics**, from data extraction to insightful dashboard creation, enabling data-backed decision-making for hospital administration and healthcare stakeholders.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Coverage:** Includes patient demographics, appointment trends, treatment success rates, and hospital performance metrics.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Built in Power BI with dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-through capabilities.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Highlights trends, patterns, and outliers to improve patient care and operational efficiency.
- **Scalable Design:** Can be adapted for other healthcare organizations or domains.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **Power BI:** For data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** For data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **SQL (MySQL):** For data extraction, querying, and transformations.
- **Power Query (M Language):** For ETL operations and data shaping within Power BI.
- **Excel:** For preliminary data inspection and validation.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Imported raw patient and operational datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized date/time formats, and normalized categorical fields.
3. **Data Transformation (ETL):**
   - Using **Python** for preprocessing and formatting.
   - Using **Power Query** to merge, filter, and shape the datasets.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified patterns, correlations, and outliers to guide dashboard design.
5. **Data Modeling:** Established relationships and created calculated columns/measures using **DAX**.
6. **Dashboard Development:** Designed an intuitive, professional layout in Power BI with:
   - KPIs for key healthcare metrics
   - Interactive charts, tables, and slicers
   - Drill-through pages for deeper insights
7. **Insights & Recommendations:** Delivered actionable insights for healthcare management teams.

## Business Impact
This dashboard can:
- Enhance decision-making with real-time, visual insights.
- Improve patient outcomes by tracking key healthcare performance metrics.
- Optimize resource allocation based on historical and forecasted trends.
